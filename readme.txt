A widget which displays the latest posts according the current category.

== Description ==

Based on the native "Recent Posts" widget, this one displays the recent posts accord the root category of the current post (or category).

You will have to define a main and secondary category.
By default, the main one is used to display the latest posts. If visitors are not currently in the secondary (or sub-categories), then it is this one which is used.

This widget is interresting when you have 2 different categories (with no linked subject) and you want to display the latest posts of the other category, rather than display all (or from the current one).

== Installation ==

1. Upload folder into to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use your 'Presentation'/'Sidebar Widgets' settings to drag and configure

== Configuration ==

The parameters are the same as the native widget, with the addition of :

* Main category ID ;
* Secondary category ID.

You will have to enter categories ID (only one per field).

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
* Support link added.

= 1.0 =
* The first version of the plugin.
